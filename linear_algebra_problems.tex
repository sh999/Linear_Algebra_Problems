	\chapter{Introduction}
	This text is a compilation of linear algebra problems from various books and my attempts at solving them.  None of the solutions are guaranteed to be correct, although I try with the best of my ability.  The main purpose is to document my own progress in learning the subject and, for my future self, to help in looking back at specific topics that I may have forgotten.  As another quote from Feyman said, "What I do not create, I do not understand."  In my view, what I do not write, I do not understand.
